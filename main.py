The input data can be in JPEG, PNG, MP4, or MOV format, and can be single-view, multi-view, or panoramic images or videos. The input data can also be in different resolutions and frame rates.")

Choose the type of 3D scene manipulation that you want to perform on the reconstructed 3D scene, such as adding, removing, or modifying objects or people in the scene, changing the lighting or texture of the scene, applying filters or effects to the scene, or generating novel views or perspectives of the scene. The software will manipulate the 3D scene according to your preferences or specifications, using a combination of computer graphics and deep learning techniques, and output the modified 3D scene.")

The output data can be in pickle, HDF5, or 3D model format for the 3D scene, and in MP4, MOV, GIF, or PNG format for the 3D simulation. The software will save the output data in the specified path, and also measure the quality and performance of the software, using metrics such as mean squared error, structural similarity index, or frames per second.")
